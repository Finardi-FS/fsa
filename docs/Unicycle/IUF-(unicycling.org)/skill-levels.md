# Proposed Skill Levels

Skill Levels are a training instrument to help riders progress with logical learning steps. The Skill Levels teach the basic unicycling skills and general movement patterns. With the Skill Levels riders learn a broad range of unicycling skills and a solid basic education to get them started with the higher class of unicycling skills.

[The Official IUF Skill Levels can be found here](https://unicycling.org/official-iuf-skill-levels/)

The first Skill Levels has been development in 1998 and these proposed skill levels were been [developed](https://unicycling.org/category/development/skill-levels/) 2010/11.  The original Skill Levels are still the official IUF Levels, with the new levels as a draft for the future. (The original Skill Levels are available on the IUF’s [Publications](https://unicycling.org/publications/) page.) You can watch [Thomas Gossmann’s talk at Unicon 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZC7QkWQaNI) outlining some problems with the original levels and how the new levels attempt to solve these problems.
